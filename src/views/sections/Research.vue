                  Current Alzheimer's treatments temporarily improve symptoms of memory loss and problems with thinking and reasoning.
These Alzheimer's treatments boost performance of chemicals in the brain that carry information from one brain cell to another. However, these treatments don't stop the
underlying decline and death of brain cells. As more cells die, Alzheimer's disease continues to progress.
